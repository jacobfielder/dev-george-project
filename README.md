## 🔍 Cool Code Snippet

```css
@keyframes gradientFlow {
  0% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
  50% {
    background-position: 100% 50%;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
```

This code uses `keyframes` that allows for a animated background that is clean and also shifts in colors.
