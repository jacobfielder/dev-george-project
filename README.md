## 🔍 Cool Code Snippet

```javascript
// Example: Debounced input search in React
const handleSearch = useCallback(
  debounce((query) => fetchResults(query), 300),
  []
);
```

This code uses `debounce` from lodash to limit how often a search API is triggered when typing in a search box. It helps improve performance and reduce API calls.
